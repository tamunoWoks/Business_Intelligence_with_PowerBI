## Power BI Highlights
The data sources power BI users can connect to arenâ€™t limited to local repositories. Users can aggregate sources locally with third-party data that is structured or unstructured to create data models. The data model lets the user build a visual representation of the stored datasets. When you have many visuals, the user can derive reports or dashboards for analysis.  
A typical usage of Power BI Desktop is:  
- Ingest data across one or more data sources.
- Model data to create reports and dashboards.
- Refine, cleanse, and visualize the data by way of analysis.
- Create reports for individual consumption.
