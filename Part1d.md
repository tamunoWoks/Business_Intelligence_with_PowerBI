## Power BI Highlights
The data sources power BI users can connect to aren’t limited to local repositories. Users can aggregate sources locally with third-party data that is structured or unstructured to create data models. The data model lets the user build a visual representation of the stored datasets. When you have many visuals, the user can derive reports or dashboards for analysis.  
A typical usage of Power BI Desktop is:  
- Ingest data across one or more data sources.
- Model data to create reports and dashboards.
- Refine, cleanse, and visualize the data by way of analysis.
- Create reports for individual consumption.

Though you can complete these activities online, the Desktop platform is purpose-built for individual user consumption or development work. It isn’t intended for groups and not until the user is ready to share the products created using Desktop do you need to expose anything to Power BI Services.  
The end user gains access to three distinct views in Power BI Desktop: Report, Data and Model. Each Power BI Desktop view carries out specific tasks:  
- **Report:**
You can create reports and visualizations after you’ve ingested and modeled the data. Users spend most of their time here post-data ingestion, transformation, and modeling.
- **Data:**
You can find all data ingested, or migrated, from tables, measures, and data sources associated with reports and visualizations created here. Sources can be local to the desktop or from a third-party data source accessible over the web.
- **Model:**
Like creating a relational data model in Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Server, or even Microsoft Access, you can fully manage the relationships among the structured tables you’ve created after you’ve ingested the necessary data using Power BI.
