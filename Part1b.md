## Business Intelligence (BI)
Simply put, Business Intelligence commonly abbreviated as `BI` is what businesses use to analyze current as well as historical data. Throughout the process of data analysis, the hope is that an organization will be able to uncover the insights needed to make the right decisions for the businessâ€™s future. By using a combination of available tools, an organization can process large datasets across multiple data sources in order to come up with findings that can then be presented to upper management.  

Using the enterprise BI tool, interested parties can produce visualizations via reports, dashboards, and KPIs as a way to ground their growth strategies in the world of facts.  
Many tools allow for collaboration and sharing among groups, because data changes over time.
