## How Power BI Works  
Let us take a look at the typical power players in an organization who make use of Power BI, how those players shape the data from its start, and what kinds of analytics outputs they might create along the way.  

These days, most vital BI programs include business analysts, data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and database administrators as part of their teams. Together, these data experts
handle evangelizing how to take raw data and use it to tell a compelling story.  

**Business analyst**
The business analyst focuses on the data footprint from a qualitative or functional perspective. When you need a person to interpret data and explain what things mean in words, not numbers, you would ask the business analyst to either gather and document the business data requirements or evaluate the data. A business analyst is the closest member of the Power BI team involved in the day-to-day decision-making process because that person often acts as a business liaison to
decision-makers and the data team. When a new report or dashboard requires creation, you often find that a business analyst is the first point of contact that a stakeholder in the business addresses. This personâ€™s vision is translatable to a workable dataset, which eventually becomes a data model.
