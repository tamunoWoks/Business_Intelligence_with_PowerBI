## The Who, How and What of Power BI  
Let us take a look at the typical power players in an organization who make use of Power BI, how those players shape the data from its start, and what kinds of analytics outputs they might create along the way.  

These days, most vital BI programs include business analysts, data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and database administrators as part of their teams. Together, these data experts
handle evangelizing how to take raw data and use it to tell a compelling story.  

**BUSINESS ANALYST**  
The business analyst focuses on the data footprint from a qualitative or functional perspective. When you need a person to interpret data and explain what things mean in words, not numbers, you would ask the business analyst to either gather and document the business data requirements or evaluate the data. A business analyst is the closest member of the Power BI team involved in the day-to-day decision-making process because that person often acts as a business liaison to
decision-makers and the data team. When a new report or dashboard requires creation, you often find that a business analyst is the first point of contact that a stakeholder in the business addresses. This person’s vision is translatable to a workable dataset, which eventually becomes a data model.

**DATA ANALYST**  
Unlike the business analyst, the data analyst does not approach analysis based on a user or the business need, but rather on the data produced. Once data enters the enterprise Information systems, these assets become the analyst’s most valuable utility. The data analyst looks to understand value by way of visualization and reporting tools, such as Power BI. As Such, the data analyst wears many hats in that role, from profiling, cleansing, and transforming raw data to presenting the data in its finalized form to the appropriate stakeholders.   

A data analyst, in addition to managing the data behind the scenes, also has a hands-on role in the management of Power BI assets. When a business analyst is tasked with translating requirements into actual products, the data analyst is thepoint person who acts as the developer. That person addresses the data and reporting requirements by turning raw data into relevant, valuable insights.  

Think of the data analyst as the gatekeeper or as an intermediary between the end user and the:  
a) Business analyst  
b) Data engineer  
c) Database administrators.  

The database administrator requires that the data analyst be familiar with the data platform and its accompanying security principles, process management, and general management principles.
