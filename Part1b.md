## Business Intelligence (BI)
Simply put, Business Intelligence commonly abbreviated as `BI` is what businesses use to analyze current as well as historical data. Throughout the process of data analysis, the hope is that an organization will be able to uncover the insights needed to make the right decisions for the businessâ€™s future. By using a combination of available tools, an organization can process large datasets across multiple data sources in order to come up with findings that can then be presented to upper management.  

Using the enterprise BI tool, interested parties can produce visualizations via reports, dashboards, and KPIs.  
Many tools allow for collaboration and sharing among groups, because data changes over time.  

Here are four actions BI tools allow to transform raw data into readily accessible data:  

**Collect and transform your data:**  
When using multiple data sources, BI tools allow you to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from structured and unstructured sources. When that process is complete, you can then store the data in a central repository so that an application can analyze and query the data.  

**Analyze data to discover trends:**  
The term data analysis can mean many things, from data discovery to data mining. The business objective, however, is all the same: It all boils down to the size of the dataset, the automation process, and the objective for pattern analysis.  

BI often provides users with a variety of modeling and analytics tools. Some come equipped with visualization options, and others have data modeling and analytics solutions for exploratory, descriptive, predictive, statistical, and even cognitive evaluation analysis.  

**Use visualization options in order to provide data clarity:**  
You may have lots of data stored in one or more repositories. Querying the data to be understood and shared among users and groups is the actual value of business intelligence tools. Visualization options often include reporting, dashboards, charts, graphics, mapping, key performance indicators, and datasets.
