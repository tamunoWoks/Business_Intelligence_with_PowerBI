## The Who, How and What of Power BI  
Let us take a look at the typical power players in an organization who make use of Power BI, how those players shape the data from its start, and what kinds of analytics outputs they might create along the way.  

These days, most vital BI programs include business analysts, data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and database administrators as part of their teams. Together, these data experts
handle evangelizing how to take raw data and use it to tell a compelling story.  

**BUSINESS ANALYST**  
The business analyst focuses on the data footprint from a qualitative or functional perspective. When you need a person to interpret data and explain what things mean in words, not numbers, you would ask the business analyst to either gather and document the business data requirements or evaluate the data. A business analyst is the closest member of the Power BI team involved in the day-to-day decision-making process because that person often acts as a business liaison to
decision-makers and the data team. When a new report or dashboard requires creation, you often find that a business analyst is the first point of contact that a stakeholder in the business addresses. This person’s vision is translatable to a workable dataset, which eventually becomes a data model.

**DATA ANALYST**  
Unlike the business analyst, the data analyst does not approach analysis based on a user or the business need, but rather on the data produced. Once data enters the enterprise Information systems, these assets become the analyst’s most valuable utility. The data analyst looks to understand value by way of visualization and reporting tools, such as Power BI. As Such, the data analyst wears many hats in that role, from profiling, cleansing, and transforming raw data to presenting the data in its finalized form to the appropriate stakeholders.   

A data analyst, in addition to managing the data behind the scenes, also has a hands-on role in the management of Power BI assets. When a business analyst is tasked with translating requirements into actual products, the data analyst is thepoint person who acts as the developer. That person addresses the data and reporting requirements by turning raw data into relevant, valuable insights.  

Think of the data analyst as the gatekeeper or as an intermediary between the end user and the:  
- Business analyst  
- Data engineer  
- Database administrators.  

The database administrator requires that the data analyst be familiar with the data platform and its accompanying security principles, process management, and general management principles.  

**DATA ENGINEER**  
The people implementing BI solutions must be able to address data on-premises as well as data in the cloud. Moreover, the data you’re managing and securing often requires that you evaluate the flow of both structured and unstructured data sources. Sometimes, it may be just the one source, but more often than not it involves many different sources. The platforms themselves run the gamut, from a typical relational database to nonrelational databases and even from data streams to file stores.  

Data must always be secure and seamlessly integrated regardless of the data service. Just like the data analysts, data engineers have to wear many hats, but to implement data tools rather than analyzing processes. That means the engineer must know how to use onpremises service tools as well as cloud data service tools to ingest and transform data across sources.  

Finally, keep in mind that you can’t plan on the sources being bound to just the organization itself, because data sources often live outside your organization’s four walls.  

Synergies often exist between the data engineer and a database administrator. You might wonder why a data engineer isn’t called a database administrator also. A data engineer doesn’t just supply advisory services, manage the hosted infrastructure, or support operational data needs. They are also responsible for crafting the agenda for business intelligence and data science initiatives. The role requires the engineer to have a handle on data in all shapes and formats. As such, the data engineer must master data wrangling, where you use the latest technology to transform and map data from its raw form to a more streamlined form,easy for BI or analytics to exploit.  

Smaller organizations often look to have a jack-of-all-trades who would be in a position to support as many tasks as possible. As you’ll quickly realize, the roles blur a bit. In the real world, data analysts, data engineers, and database administrators work together, often sharing duties and responsibilities. It’s not uncommon to have an overseer role with a single title — commonly, data engineer.  
A database administrator, analyst, or even a BI professional can easily transition into the data engineer role, as long as they grasp the requirements of the people, processes, and technologies used to sift through the data.

**DATA SCIENTIST**  
The data scientist is laser focused on creating and executing advanced analytics to extract the data from the systems put in place by the business analysts, data analysts, data engineers, and database administrators. They perform analytics routines on descriptive, diagnostic, prescriptive, predictive, and cognitive data. Whether the analysis conducted is quantitative using statistical tooling or machine learning functionality to detect patterns and anomalies or the data requires qualitative evaluation, the end goal is to create a well built model.  

Building data models with analytics is only part of a data scientist’s responsibility. As the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence continues to thrive, the data scientist is tasked with exploring deep learning and performing experiments with complex data problems with various coding languages using algorithmic techniques.  

It’s no secret that most of the time spent by a data scientist is on addressing issues related to fixing data, also known as data wrangling. By having a team, the data scientist can often speed up the process. Better yet, by using tools, such as Power BI, that automate many of the roles in the business intelligence and data science lifecycle, the data scientist can more easily address the questions that require answers.

**DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR**  
Your database administrator handles implementing and managing the database infrastructure. In some organizations, the database is entirely cloud enabled. Legacy organizations, on the other hand, have often kept their database on-premises or in a state of flux, resulting in a hybrid data platform deployment. When using Power BI, you’ll likely have your database administrator build solutions on top of
Microsoft Azure-based data services, including Microsoft Azure SQL.  

Whereas the data engineer or analyst might handle the availability and performance of the database solution, ensuring that stakeholders can identify and implement the policies and procedures they need in order to support the data environment properly, the data administrator ensures the wellness of the database as well as the infrastructure that the organization’s data runs on.  

When you try to sum up who does what in the Power BI data lifecycle, keep these two points in mind:  
- Your business analyst, data analyst, and data engineer are involved in the creation of data and its manageability. The key words here are ingestion, transformation, validation, cleansing, and creation.
- Your database administrator, on the other hand, handles the systems which ensure that the data remains healthy. The responsibility isn’t just limited to data reliability, but security as well.  

## Understanding How Data Comes To Life  
Data takes time to nurture and the focus should be on preparation. As you learn more about the organization’s people, processes, and technologies, your data requirements evolve, and those evolving requirements end up informing your data model. 
 
Ultimately, data management is all encompassing because it overlays every phase of the data lifecycle.  

**Prepare:**  
Though the preparation stage is the most focused and tedious, the entire data lifecycle is influenced by preparation.  

Data preparation requires a business analyst to evaluate the business’s needs and a data analyst to construct an appropriate data profile for cleansing and transformation. The data may come from one source or many sources.  

The trick is to determine what is needed to ensure that performance isn’t impacted negatively and to then ensure that the models and reports meet these predetermined requirements. (Requirement examples here would include data and memory volume or perhaps CPU use for processing.) Such processes include gathering data, looking for patterns, and anomalies, and synthesizing the data into meaningful requirements.

**Model:**  
After data preparation is complete, organizations take this opportunity to model the data. In this context, data modeling can be seen as a process where all those raw pieces of data have been formalized and structured. The goal is to decide how the organized datasets can relate to each other. After you define the relationships, you can then build on the models by creating metrics, calculations, and rule sets.  

The model is a critical component in the data lifecycle. Without a model, the end user cannot produce reports or conduct analyses for an organization. A properly designed model is the key to delivering accurate and trusted results, especially as more organizations begin to work with large datasets.  

Anytime you experience performance issues using Power BI, start by evaluating your model. Examples that may show performance as an issue include report refresh rates taking a bit longer than they should, data loading and preparation lagging, or data rendering from an often-accessed dataset that’s taking a tad too long to query.  

**Visualize:**  
Visualizing data helps organizations better understand business problems in ways that plain text can’t convey. The old saying “A picture is worth a thousand words” surely applies here. Visualization can make data come alive. It tells compelling stories, enabling business decision-makers to gain needed insights reasonably quickly.  

A good BI solution such as Power BI incorporates many visualization options that make report outputs easier for decision-makers to understand. The visualizations aggregate the data to guide the professional through the dataset quickly. Reports built on these visualizations can be crucial aids when it comes to driving decision-making actions and behaviors in an organization. Given that many organizations don’t even look at the structured dataset, never mind the raw data that the business or data analyst spends so much time evaluating as part of the preparation and data modeling stage.  

Not all visualizations are proper for a dataset. It pays to take the time to fully understand the business problem you’re trying to
solve, to see whether all data points are necessary. Too much data may make it more difficult to detect key patterns.  

Power BI has built-in AI capabilities that guide the best-fit visualization for reporting without requiring code. Consider using the Questions and Answers feature, trying out the various visualization options, or using Quick Insights to map your data model with the best-fit solution in Power BI.

**Analyze:**  
No two individuals analyze data in the same way. The analysis task is another step in the process when crafting your data model and interpreting your visualizations. Consider analysis is an activity that often coincides across roles. You may continually have to analyze your data, the model you derived, and your visualization output to make sure that accuracy follows.  

One should ensure accuracy in finding patterns, noticing trends, communicating with others, and even predicting outcomes based on data, even if you find anomalous tendencies. Platforms such as Power BI make data analysis more accessible because the process is simplified for business stakeholders when it comes to completing each one of those tasks.  

Power BI is a desktop solution as well as a cloud-based one. You can do most of your business analysis, data analysis, data modeling, and visualization activities using Power BI Desktop. You can analyze the data on your own using Power BI Desktop, assuming that you’ve connected your data model to the proper data source. However, if you want to share your data or analyze it with others, you must use Power BI Services.  

**Manage:**  
Power BI, consists of lots of different apps. The outputs produced are plentiful: reports, dashboards, workspaces, datasets, KPIs, and even other apps. On a well organized team, every member usually manages one or more byproducts supporting the management of the Power BI assets, allowing for the sharing and distribution of data.  

Power BI fosters collaboration between teams and individuals. Sharing of content means ensuring that the right stakeholders gain access to the product you’ve created.  

Security can be a bit challenging in large organizations. Your business analyst, data analyst, and data engineer each has a role in making sure that the right people have access to only what they need. The data scientist makes sure that the data assets being created are of high value. And of course, the database administrator ensures that the data house is always open for business by managing the infrastructure that all stakeholders support as part of the data lifecycle for business intelligence using Power BI.  

## Types of Data Analytics
You can produce five types of analytics using Power BI: 
- Descriptive
- Diagnostic
- Predictive
- Prescriptive
- Cognitive.  

Depending on the business goal and application within Power BI, the analytic products are a bit different. The five types of analytics are described below, including each one’s purpose and where you’ll most likely have success using each analytics type.  

**Descriptive:** 
Helps answer questions based on historical data. Descriptive analytics also summarize large datasets and describe outcomes.
