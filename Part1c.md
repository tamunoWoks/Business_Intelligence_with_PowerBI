## Power BI Versions
Picking out the correct version of Power BI is a choice that boils down to wants, needs, scale, and, of course, money. Some versions are free, and other versions can be expensive. The most obvious difference is that some versions are desktop or server-based whereas others offer online-only capabilities.

### Why Power BI versus Excel?
Microsoft markets Power BI as a way to connect and visualize data using acunified, scalable platform that offers self-service and enterprise business intelligence that can help you gain deep insights into data.  

Doesn’t Microsoft Excel do this already? What makes Power BI different? Ask yourself these questions:
- What level of analytics does your organization need?  
- Is collaboration an issue?  
- What is the size of your dataset?  
- Is there a pricing issue?  
- How meaningful are visualizations to you or your team?

Both Excel and Power BI can handle all five requirements, but Power BI is a significant upgrade in terms of Data volume, breadth of visualization options, cost, and collaboration.  
- Power BI supplies an array of high-level analytics offerings that Excel doesn’t include, such as the ability to create dashboards, key performance indicators (KPI), visualizations, and alerts.
- Power BI has significant collaboration capabilities, whereas Excel has limited data collaboration options.
- Though Excel can help when it comes to creating advanced reports, if you want to build data models that include predictive and machine learning assets, you have to turn to specific versions of Power BI.
- There is no single free version of Excel. On the other hand, you can start with Power BI for free. You can also purchase premium alternatives if you need advanced features.
