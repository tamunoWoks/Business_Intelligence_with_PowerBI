## Power BI Versions
Picking out the correct version of Power BI is a choice that boils down to wants, needs, scale, and, of course, money. Some versions are free, and other versions can be expensive. The most obvious difference is that some versions are desktop or server-based whereas others offer online-only capabilities.

### Why Power BI versus Excel?
Microsoft markets Power BI as a way to connect and visualize data using acunified, scalable platform that offers self-service and enterprise business intelligence that can help you gain deep insights into data.  

Doesn’t Microsoft Excel do this already? What makes Power BI different? Ask yourself these questions:
- What level of analytics does your organization need?  
- Is collaboration an issue?  
- What is the size of your dataset?  
- Is there a pricing issue?  
- How meaningful are visualizations to you or your team?

Both Excel and Power BI can handle all five requirements, but Power BI is a significant upgrade in terms of Data volume, breadth of visualization options, cost, and collaboration.  
- Power BI supplies an array of high-level analytics offerings that Excel doesn’t include, such as the ability to create dashboards, key performance indicators (KPI), visualizations, and alerts.
- Power BI has significant collaboration capabilities, whereas Excel has limited data collaboration options.
- Though Excel can help when it comes to creating advanced reports, if you want to build data models that include predictive and machine learning assets, you have to turn to specific versions of Power BI.
- There is no single free version of Excel. On the other hand, you can start with Power BI for free. You can also purchase premium alternatives if you need advanced features.

In summary, Power BI integrates business intelligence (BI) and data visualization so that users can create custom and interactive dashboards, KPIs, and reports. Simultaneously, Microsoft Excel is limited in handling data analytics, mathematical operations, or data organization using a spreadsheet.  

Power BI can extract and format data from more than a single data source type. Because Power BI handles extensive data ingestion the process is, by nature, much faster.  

Furthermore, because Power BI can connect with various data sources, the range of outputs, including dashboards and reports, is more interactive, whereas Excel is limited in scope.  

Above all, Power BI is a tool for data visualization and analysis that allows for collaboration. At the same time, Excel limits sharing and data analysis to a limited number of end users.  

### Power BI license options
Licensing refers to the products a customer is procuring, whereas version deals with where Power BI runs: on a desktop, from a server, or in the cloud. One or more Power BI products may be required in order to fully support deployments of Power BI. In some cases, you may require a hybrid solution of desktop and online versions of the product.  

You can choose from four product license options: 
- Power BI Desktop
- Power BI Free
- Power BI Pro
- Power BI Premium.  
Some of these products are included with all three product licensing options, whereas others are specific to either the Pro or Premium version. Let’s review each product license:













### Linking Power BI and Azure
All Microsoft cloud applications ultimately use Azure, the cloud platform that supports storage, security, and application management. With
so many modern applications requiring analytic outputs, Microsoft recognized that an API could complement its Power BI offerings with Azure. Called Power BI Embedded, this Premium Power BI feature requires an Azure account to be associated with the enterprise license.  

Reports and dashboards published in a Power BI workspace can be deployable via API to a web page or application. With Power BI Embedded, end users don’t need a Power BI Pro license to view the content so long as they embed the targeted content within the Webpage or Web applications.  

Reports and dashboards can be customized to meet user experience specifications at the organization level. Best yet, content can be configured based on user identity and row-level security using Microsoft Azure Active Directory, the cloudbased identity management platform.
