## About Power BI
What does Business intelligence require?  
-	Querying data sources
-	Reporting & Caching data
-	Visualizing data.  

On a broader scope, business intelligence requires taking structured, unstructured and semi-structured data and make sense of it. It also entails delivering robust business analytics outputs for executive consumption and delivering complex reports, visualizations, dashboards and KPIs.  

Power BI allows users to visualize and discover what is truly essential in their vast data resources. Users can share data at scale with ease, and depending on your role you can create, view or share data using Power BI via the desktop app, the cloud-based service, or the mobile app.  

### WHAT IS DATA?
Data refers to raw facts, figures or information that can be in the form of numbers, text, images, audio, video or any other format.  

**Key characteristics of data include:**
-	It is usually raw and unprocessed
-	It can be structured (e.g., spreadsheets, databases), semi-structured or unstructured (e.g., social media posts, emails, videos).
-	It can be quantitative (e.g., temperature, sales figures) or qualitative (e.g., customer feedback, interview responses).  
Data should not be confused with information. Data is usually raw and unprocessed while information is processed, structured and meaningful data that provides contest.  

**Examples of Data:**
-	Numbers: Sales records, temperatures, stock prices.
-	Text: Social media posts, books, emails.
-	Media: Photos, videos, audio recordings.
-	Sensor Data: GPS signals, health tracker metrics. 

#### STRUCTURED DATA
Structured data conforms to a tabular format; this means each column and row maintains an interrelationship. A formal specification of tables with rows and columns is commonly referred to as **DATA SCHEMA**.  

The most accessible data sources for Power BI are structured. Platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Azure SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Azure Table Storage, Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and several others all offer robust structured data options.  

#### UNSTRUCTURED DATA
Unstructured data is ambiguous, without any rhyme, reason, or consistency. Any video, audio, photo, or text file is considered unstructured data. 

#### SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA
Semi-structured data has some formality, but it isnâ€™t stored in a relational system, and it has no set format. Semi-structured data contains tags that make the data easier to organize in some form of hierarchy.  

Non-relational data systems or NoSQL databases are best associated with semi-structured data.
